# API Proxy Server [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/somramnani/api-proxy-server/branch/setup%2Fcodecov/graph/badge.svg?token=P7CKS55P9U)](https://codecov.io/gh/somramnani/api-proxy-server)

## Introduction

A proxy server built in ExpressJS that bypasses a CORs error on an API request. The server acts as a mediator between the client and server by adding CORS headers to a request. It operates between the frontend web application that initiates the request and the server that provides the response data.

<!-- ## Usage
In your front end application make a get request to https://api-proxy-server-steel.vercel.app/ with the corresponding method using one of the following routes below.

### GET Request Route
`/api/get/{APIlink}`

### POST Request Route
`/api/post/{APIlink}/{params}` -->
